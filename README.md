# SMARTBIN
✅ Procedure for Smart Bin 

1. Required Components
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04)
Buzzer or LED (for alerts)
Servo motor (optional, for automatic lid)
Power source (battery or adapter)
Wires, resistors

2. Hardware Setup
Mount the ultrasonic sensor inside the bin’s lid or top area, facing downward to measure waste level.
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the microcontroller:
Trig and Echo pins to digital pins on Arduino
Optional: Connect a servo motor to control the lid based on distance detection (e.g., hand detection near lid).
Connect a buzzer or LED to indicate when the bin is full.

3. Microcontroller Programming
Use the Arduino IDE to program the microcontroller.

Key features to include in the code:
Measure the distance from the sensor to waste surface.
Calculate the percentage fill of the bin.
Trigger buzzer/LED when bin is ≥ 90% full.
Optional: Open lid with servo motor when hand is detected close to the bin (another short-range distance check).

4. Testing
Place objects gradually in the bin and observe sensor readings.
Ensure the buzzer or LED activates when the bin is nearly full.
Test the lid mechanism (if included).

5. Deployment and Maintenance
Place the bin in the target location.
Ensure the sensor stays clean and unobstructed.
Replace or recharge batteries as needed.
Periodically check connections and clean the bin and sensor.

⚙️ Optional Enhancements
Use an SD card module to store bin usage logs for manual download.
Use a Real Time Clock (RTC) module to log the time of filling events.
